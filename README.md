Portfolio V2.0 Wanting to turn SPA to multi-page allowing for more content.


Things I would like to add:

Login feature where I can login as a developer to update my profile easily. Specifically thinking having simple input field (as logged in user) that allows me to create a <Project> with correct data

I would then need a Database to pull the data from, and an input field to connect it up with the database.
